        <h3>Our Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to C#, fully automating and commoditizing the process such that the project can easily synchronize with the Java Lucene release schedule.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Maintaining the high-performance requirements expected of a first class C# search engine library.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Maximize usability and power when used within the .NET runtime. To that end, it will present a highly idiomatic, carefully tailored API that takes advantage of many of the special features of the .NET runtime.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
